# Viking-neat-mcts 

Create an agent for the board game Hnefatafl using the AlphaGo algorithm as shown here  [https://joshvarty.github.io/AlphaZero/](AlphaZero algorithm). The algorithm will use MCTS from the library [https://github.com/zxqfl/mcts](MCTS) and NEAT from the libary 
[https://github.com/TLmaK0/rustneat](NEAT) in order to train the  model

## TODOs
- [ ] Refactor
- [ ] Connect the MCTS model and the NEAT simulation into one
